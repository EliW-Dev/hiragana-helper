# Hiragana Helper

A simple locally hosted site to help with learning Hiragana.

## Description

built with HTML, CSS and vanilla js.

The site will show an image of a Hiragana character along with 6 possible pronunciations; a correct answer will show a new character, 4 wrong answers will show the correct one.

Intended to be a simple way for me to help memorise Hiragaga, nothing serious, just a wee bit o' fun.
